# InSituReflectometry
Code for Arduino in-situ laser reflectometer utilizing stroboscopic effect

This code is for Arduino driven refelctometer that utilizes stroboscopic effect.
The setup consists of a laser diode, a photodiode or light-dependent resistor, and an Arduino board.

It allows to measure evaporation of a solvent in-situ during spin-coating. The laser diode flashes like a strobe. The flash frequency can be adjusted to match the spin-coater speed. Thanks to the programmed flashing, the laser light always shines on the same spot on the rotating disc.
